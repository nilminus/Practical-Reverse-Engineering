Sample H: The function sub_13846 references several structures whose types are not entirely clear. Your task is to first recover the function prototype and then try to reconstruct the structure fields. After reading Chapter 3, return to this exercise to see if your understanding has changed. (Note: This sample is targeting Windows XP x86.)
